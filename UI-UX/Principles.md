User Centered Design

User research -> User Journeys and scenarios -> Wireframing(Balsamiq) -> Prototyping -> Usability testing. 

1. Planning -> define the problem by understanding users needs, goals, motivations
2. Analysis -> Understanding your users, prioritize features based on what users actually want. 
3. Design -> ideating, prototyping and iterating based on user feedback, low cost way to see if that works
4. Implementation -> user testing, analysis the user feedback
5. Maintenance -> user testing, analysis the user feedback
