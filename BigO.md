# Big O

Describes an upper bound on the time. An algorithm that prints all the values in an array could be described as O(N)


# Big Omega

The equivalent concept but for lower bound. 


# Big theta

Means both big O and big Omega, That is an lgorithm is \theta(N) if it is both O(N) and Omega(N)


## Three Cases

Best Case O(N)
Worst Case O(N^2)
